```py
def logout_view(request):
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        if  hasattr(request.user, "instructor"):
            logout(request)
            messages.success(request, "instructor logout successfully!!!")
            return redirect("instructor_logout_view")
        elif hasattr(request.user, "student"):
            logout(request)
            messages.success(request, "student logout successfully!!!")
            return redirect("logout_view")
    return redirect("home_view")
```

- The `hasattr(request.user, "instructor")` and `hasattr(request.user, "student")` are checking whether the authenticated user has an Instructor or Student profile linked to their account.
- This works because the OneToOneField in Django creates a reverse relation that allows the user to have either a Student or Instructor object attached to them.
- Django uses lowercase names for reverse relationships by default, which is why we use `user.student or user.instructor`
