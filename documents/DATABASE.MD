# Database

A **database** is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to manage, store, and retrieve data efficiently, allowing users to perform various operations on that data. Here are some key aspects of databases:

## Key Components of a Database

1. **Data**: The actual information stored in the database, which can include text, numbers, images, and more.

2. **Database Management System (DBMS)**: Software that facilitates the creation, manipulation, and administration of the database.  
   **Examples**: MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB.

3. **Schema**: The structure that defines how data is organized within the database, including tables, fields, data types, and relationships.

4. **Tables**: In relational databases, data is organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of that record.

5. **Queries**: Commands used to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data from the database, often written in SQL (Structured Query Language) for relational databases.

# Database Management System

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to create, manage, and manipulate databases. It serves as an interface between the end users and the database

# Types of DBMS

## 1. Relational DBMS (RDBMS)

Organizes data in tables with rows and columns, using Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation.

**Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.

## 2. NoSQL DBMS

Designed for unstructured data and supports various data models.  
**Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra.

## 3. Network DBMS

## 4. Hierarchical DBMS

Organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.  
**Examples**: IBM Information Management System.

Uses a graph structure to allow more complex relationships among data entities.  
**Examples**: Integrated Data Store.

## 5. Object-Oriented DBMS

Integrates object-oriented programming principles with database capabilities.  
**Examples**: db4o.

### Relational Database

Relational databases models data by storing them in columns and rows in tables.
If there are multiple tables, we can create relationships between them and that relationships can be involved in our queries.

# Three major databases in use

- Postgres
- Oracle
- MySql

# SQL

Structured Query Language is the language we use to issue commands to the database.

- Create/insert data
- Read/Select data
- Update data
- Delete Data

# Database model

A database model or database schema is the structure or format of a database, described in a formal language supported by a database management system.
